Just maybe I'm crazy
The world spins round and round and round
Shi-di-ri-di-duy, shi-di-ri-di-da-na
Shi-di-ri-di-duy, shi-di-ri-di-da-na

I want you to want me as I dance
Round and round and round
Shi-di-ri-di-duy, shi-di-ri-di-da-na
Shi-di-ri-di-duy, shi-di-ri-di-da-na

Forever and ever go, go, go wild dancers

Day-na-day-na want to be loved
Day-na gonna take my wild chances
Day-na-day-na freedom above
Day-na-da-na-da I'm wild dancing
